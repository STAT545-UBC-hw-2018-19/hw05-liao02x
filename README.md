# STAT545 homework 05
This repo is for STAT545 homework 05.
- [hw05.html](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw05-liao02x/blob/master/hw05.html) is for html review.
- [hw05.Rmd](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw05-liao02x/blob/master/hw05.Rmd) is the corresponding R markdown source file.

**For this assignment, because `plotly` is a html widget, we should check the .html file and see what it looks like.**

**Since rawgit is down, and we can't really turn this repo into a github.io page, I guess the only way to see it is to download the repo and open it locally. Sorry for any inconvenience.**

**R.I.P rawgit.com**



**Or, I did fork this repo to my own github account which makes it possible to create a github.io page and do some online html preview. So the link is provided below, and I think it is a good replacement.**
