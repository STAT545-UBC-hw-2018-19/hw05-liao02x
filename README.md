# STAT545 homework 05
This repo is for STAT545 homework 05.
- [hw03.html](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw05-liao02x/blob/master/hw05.html) is for html review.
- [hw03.Rmd](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw05-liao02x/blob/master/hw05.Rmd) is the corresponding R markdown source file.

**For this assignment, because `plotly` is a html widget, we should check the .html file and see what it looks like.**

**The .html file can show things properly, and the link below is the entry for rendered html page.**
